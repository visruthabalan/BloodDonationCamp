This project is a web-based application developed using Django that aims to make blood donation more accessible and efficient. It provides a simple yet powerful platform where blood donors can register their details, and hospitals or individuals in need can search for eligible donors based on blood group and location.

The system is designed to help during emergencies when quick access to suitable donors is critical. By maintaining a centralized donor database, hospitals and organizations can instantly find and contact donors nearby, reducing delays in the life-saving process.

Key features include a donor registration form, a search functionality that filters by blood group and city, and a user-friendly interface built with Django templates. The project uses Django’s ORM for secure and efficient database management, ensuring all records are stored and retrieved seamlessly.

This project demonstrates how Django can be used to build practical, real-world applications that solve social problems. It is lightweight, easy to deploy, and can be extended with additional features such as Google Maps integration, email/SMS notifications, and role-based access for hospitals and donors.

In short, this application promotes the motto: “Donate Blood, Save Lives.”
